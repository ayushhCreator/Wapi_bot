# NOTE: Workflow files have expected type-checking false positives
# These don't affect runtime behavior:
# - TypedDict allows dynamic keys at runtime (bad-typed-dict-key)
# - Protocol duck typing works at runtime (bad-argument-type)
# - LangGraph has complex type annotations (no-matching-overload)
#
# Use `ruff check` for actual code quality issues.
